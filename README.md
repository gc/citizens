# Citizens

This plugin adds 'fake npcs' (citizens) to RuneScape to bring more life and action to the world.

# Guidelines For Adding Citizens

1. Citizens should 'fit in' with runescape, and look natural for the area that they're in (e.g. no zalcano standing in
   varrock square).
2. Currently, we do not add "fake players" (e.g. like "CowSlayer37" wearing dharoks armor).
3. Citizens should not interfere with normal npcs/objects or gameplay.
4. Citizens should be reasonably thought out and unique, and feel like they have a purpose/lore behind them. (e.g. don't
   just add a bunch quickly in random places with no
   thought.)
5. There should be no lag or resource issues as a result of the plugin/citizens.

# Citizen Types

- Scenery; plain objects (e.g. a pot of flowers)
- Stationary Citizens; any citizen which does not ever move tiles.
- Wandering Citizens; a citizen which wanders randomly around a defined box area.
- Scripted Citizens; a citizen which has a set script to follow on a loop (e.g. walk here, do something, walk back)
